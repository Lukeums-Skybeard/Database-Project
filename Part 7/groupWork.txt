Alexander Altman: Alexander was the dedicated first draft coder for all project parts. He made sure that the basic framework
of the database was always at least minimally functional.

Schuyler Davis: Schuyler filled the role of supervisory and conceptualizing. Schuyler was in charge of stepping back and examining
project implementation from different angles. He also ensured things "made sense" for our data domain. He filled a mostly "administrative" role.

Timothy Gibson: Timothy was the second draft coder and scripter. Timothy checked the work of Alexander, making sure database
implementation was coherent. Timothy also wrote the bulk of the scripts that generated the data for the database. Timothy also worked along
side Alexander in making sure implementation was on task.
