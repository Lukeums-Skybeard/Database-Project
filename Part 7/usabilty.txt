Someone working in a furniture store would definitely consider using our database. Our web enabled database can search
for specific pieces of furniture that customers would search for, and this search is done in a similar way to other
product websites. The data is also presented in a list that doesn't mirror the style of an actual product page but
presents the appropriate data. This is enough of a proof of concept that it could present it in a way that "looks good"
to a customer.

Our approach is largely worse than similar systems. This is simply due to the style in which the data from the
database is presented. With ample time, we are confident that we could ensure that the data for each tuple is presented
in a usable way that could mirror a product page. Our approach to the presentation of the data is what we believe to be
 close to how professional databases store information on products in an online store. Our presentation, however,
 leaves much to be desired, as simple tables with almost arbitrary information is not aesthetically pleasing.
