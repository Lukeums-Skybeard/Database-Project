For extra functionality, we decided to implement a search function into the webpage. This search bar allows a "customer"
to search the database in a "keyword" fashion, just like they would on a real store website. This way, we can search the
items that our store can sell in a way that an actual customer would and return results that are relevant to that search.
For example, searching for "Table" returns all of the tables in the database and even shows a picture next to the item.
Granted this is just a placeholder image for each of the different items that the store sells but it is a proof of concept
more than anything.
